# Bomb project - OOP assignment
---------------------
## Branching
  - `master` stores release product.
  - `develop` stores latest update of developing product.
  - **Don't push any thing directly to branch `master` and `develop`, every new change must push to new branch,
then create `pull request` to branch `develop`**
